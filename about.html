        About
    </h2>

    <p>
        My name is Juan Manuel although I am known as Juanma. I was born in Barcelona (Spain) in June 1999. I am currently studying Computer Engineering at the Autonomous University of Barcelona. I started programming in 2018. I have been working with models of deep learning, process automation and streaming on demand, among other things, these last 2 years.
        I love free code and linux.
        The languages ​​that I have tried the most are: Python (Scripts, TensorflowV2, OpenCV), C ++ (QT), Java (JSP, Hibernate, Android) and C (Linux Sockets).
        Apart from programming, another passion I have is teaching, I love teaching people about this world.
        In general, I usually program alone, but I adapt very well in work groups when carrying out a project.
        I hope that one day we can collaborate.
    </p>
